**Water Meters** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the utilities industry. 

The dataset consists of 1244 images with 1244 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*water meter data*).

Images in the Water Meters dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the [TrainingData.pro, UAE](https://trainingdata.pro/data-market?utm_source=kaggle).
