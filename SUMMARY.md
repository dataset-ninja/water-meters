**Water Meters** (Water Meters) is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 1244 images with 1244 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*water meter data*).

Each image in the Water Meters dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (1244 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
